8) Certain models give us the same results, and others do not. The naive bayes, decision tree and perceptron classifiers
   all give the same results all the time. This is because they are all simple mathematial equations. We are giving the 
   same numbers to the probability, entropy and actviation functions. As such, we always get the same results.

   The multi-layered perceptron classifier however, does nto give us the same results every time. This is because the
   weights re-initialized randomly everytime. As such, we are no longer using the same numbers in the same equations, 
   which gives us different results.

   ##Check if perceptron has random weights, check if mlp has random weights
